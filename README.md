Python Implementation of Karel for CS106A at Stanford

Everything important is located in stanfordkarel/.

./autograder should run the pytest tests and print out any output differences in the world.

In the future, I hope to add:
- Automatic style checking
- Ways of determining the student's strategy from observing Karel movements
- Autograde more worlds, broken down by assignment
- Allow students to autograde their own work
